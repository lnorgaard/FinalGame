        <h1>Room 16</h1>
        <p>Alex has a small mallet in their bag resembling the ones used to get to fire extinguishers. Thank god for emergency preparedness. It’s just strong enough that with a couple swings, most of these old desk locks can be broken. “Here, I’m gonna look for any drawer that’s already open. You try busting this one open.” Alex passes you the mallet and begins searching. Your first few swings are timid, afraid of making too much noise and getting caught, but it occurs to you that no one is here to catch you. Yeah, your and Alex’s life is at stake, along with lots of others. Your swings become more confident and eventually the drawer breaks open.<br><br>

        Nothing.<br><br>

        But a few drawers later after Alex had returned to you finding nothing in the already unlocked ones, you find a lockbox.<br><br>

        “Is there nothing else in the drawer?” Alex asks, searching for something like a slip of paper that someone may have carelessly left with the code. Unfortunately, there’s nothing. It doesn’t seem like the mallet is strong enough to work on this kind of box either, it’s much heftier than the cheap desks.<br><br>

        Alex lets out a sigh. “Alright, let’s keep looking. I’m sure there’s a code somewhere.”<br><br></p>
