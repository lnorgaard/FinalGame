        <h1>Room 28</h1>
        <p>You and Alex stand in the entrance to a lab modified to operating room via some curtains, hospital carts, and hundreds of containers of pieced up bodies. Alex covers their mouth, shaking. Not only are there packets of blood and organs on melting ice, but jars of fingers, brains, hearts, and bone marrow. “Are you okay?” You ask, extremely concerned that Alex may pass out at any moment.<br><br>

        Alex swallows hard. “It’s in there.”<br><br>

        ‘It’ turns out to be the key, and ‘there’ turns out to be a jar of preserved liver. “Oh my god, you’re kidding.” You have to choke back some vomit.<br><br>

        “These nurses really knew how to screw with me,” Alex snorts to themself before nudging you in the shoulder. “Go get it.”<br><br>

        Your eyes go wide. “Me?”<br><br>

        “You got it from the dead guy.”<br><br>

        “That was very different.”<br><br>

        “Oh come on! What the hell are you here for?” Alex whines. “I’ve always been the one finding the keys! Besides, you’re already this sick. If I get worse, how will I keep carrying both of our weights?” The derisive words cause a swell of rage within you so strong you feel dazed. They must be kidding. You try to come up with a retort, but the tempest of emotions cloud your thoughts. You need the last of that medicine.<br><br>

        “Fine, give me some pills first.”<br><br>

        Alex clutches their bag defensively. “Get the key first.” Your conversation has rapidly devolved to a battle of wills. You glower at Alex momentarily, considering if you can win, but at this point, you’re beyond exhausted. There’s no point picking fights in your current condition, and you need the key either way. Mind decided, you tromp over to the glass jar and take a deep breath. Then, fueled by anger, you throw off the cap and swiftly dunk your hand in. The sticky liver brushes your skin, causing you to gag, but you manage to pull the key all the way out before collapsing to the ground to hurl. Alex seems ever so slightly impressed, if not amused. Once all the crackers you’ve digested over the past few hours have settled on the floor, you shake your hand aggressively to fling off any excess liquid and wipe it on your clothes to reduce the burning sensation it left behind. You glare at Alex with sharp eyes. “Happy?”<br><br></p>
