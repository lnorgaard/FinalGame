        <h1>Room 6</h1>
        <p>Alex continues. “They didn’t tell the patients, but I’ve done some snooping around.  A few days ago, they determined some patients were “too sick to save.” AKA the government decided to cut-off funding. They’ve been slowly moving the worst cases to the lower floors and locking them in… essentially to die.”<br><br>

        Noticing a disturbed fear wash over you, Alex places a comforting hand on your shoulder. “No, it’s okay! It’s okay. Hey, we’re both alive, right? And we’re gonna get out.” Their hand slides down to grasp yours and guides you back to where they were behind the desks before. “I’ve been scavenging for a while now, and they haven’t been particularly careful about covering-up their tracks.” Alex retrieves a nursing kit from off the ground and drops it on the desk to display its contents to you. “I’ve found a lot of dirt that suggests the funding isn’t gone yet, it’s just been directed to research on an antidote instead. Not to mention I’ve got more meds, water and crackers to take them with, and most importantly…” They shift to a drawer recently busted open and pick up a small bronze key.<br><br>

        “To the stairs.” Alex informs. Goosebumps run down your neck. Somehow seeing the keys, all at once the gravity of the situation hits you. These empty halls, this one in a million chance for escape. You could’ve actually died here, but you also might survive.<br><br>

        You grip your hands into a fist and look Alex in the eye. Alex grins. “What do you say? Come with me?”<br><br></p>
