        <h1>Room 11-1</h1>
        <p>You need that medicine, and soon. You turn to the stairs. They appear farther than before, but you use the desks as crutches to slowly make your way to them. Finally at the door, you struggle with your weak grip to turn the round knob, but eventually get it with two-hands and the weight of your body pushing the door open. However, your momentum carries through and you fall to the ground, landing on your elbow roughly with a loud crack that echos against the stairs. You let out a loud scream, rolling over and clutching the arm close to your chest. It’s broken, definitely broken. It hurts way too much to be okay. You can’t even force your eyes open to look. You’re too tired, too scared, too weak. Tears roll down your cheeks as you sob against the cement floor. You won’t be able to get up the stairs if you can’t pull yourself up with both arms. Your only hope is if Alex heard you scream.<br><br>

        But Alex was too far ahead by now. You’re alone, unable to stand up on your own anymore, growing weaker by the minute. It is here you will die, from your own foolish isolation.<br><br></p>
