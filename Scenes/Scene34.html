        <h1>Room 34</h1>
        <p>You rip the needle from Alex’s hands and roughly inject the antidote to your thigh. “NO!” Alex shrieks, immediately jumping at you to tear the needle away, hoping some medicine will remain, but you dodge their frantic attack and dart out of the room. “I won’t let you escape!” Alex trips an alarm from the other room and continues pursuing you in a fury as sirens roar from the walls. You run, down the hall, down the stairs, down the next hall, not stopping as the sirens grow louder drowning out the wails of Alex as they fall farther and farther behind. The antidote must’ve included a huge hit of adrenaline because the pounding in your chest is agonizing, but you don’t dare stop. By the time you reach the main entrance, the doors have been broken open and the police have arrived. You fall to the ground and are promptly swept away, out of the building to be detained until further notice.<b><b>
It turns out, the hospital was persisting with research illegally on live subjects and had been under surveillance for a while for unethical testing. After questioning you, the police attempted to send you back into quarantine at a new facility, but you emphatically insist you’ve been cured. Intrigued, your new doctors confirmed this with some testing, and after a couple more intense sessions of questioning and donating bodily samples, you were released.<b><b>
As for Alex, they were also detained and questioned by the police. It turns out you two were the only remaining survivors in that hospital: One patient and one test subject. When they tried to remove Alex from the hospital, however, they resisted fervently. They were reported to have physically fought the the officers, exclaiming that they couldn’t leave without Jamie, who was found to be another patient of the hospital. Sadly, this person had been confirmed dead long ago. Because of being diagnosed with potential PTSD and labeled unstable, Alex was not permitted to see the body before it was sent off to the morgue. Using the documents that they collected, another hospital was able to develop and mass produce the antidote Alex had been scarred for. In the media, Alex was venerated as a hero for suffering the torture of the researchers, saving you, and collecting the valuable documentation that contributed to reconstructing the cure, but was later discovered dead in their apartment after committing suicide.<b><b></p>
