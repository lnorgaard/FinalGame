        <p>The need to search efficiently outweighs your need for the medicine right now. “I’ll go search this one!” You respond, pointing at the closest door to your right. You enter what appears to be a research library. It’s about the size of a classroom, with many shelves of files and a few desks with microscopes and other tools. A notebook has also been left open on one, which strikes you as a good place to start.<br><br>

        You struggle to make sense of the heavy medical jargon. Most of it isn’t what you saw in high school bio/chem. However, after a few pages, the info you can pick up starts piecing together. Supposedly, a few people who were coming to visit loved ones in the hospital were found to not contract the disease. They were in fact immune to it altogether, and so the hospital began… kidnapping them… to perform tests…<br><br>

        The photos paperclipped within the notebook grow progressively more graphic in nature, and some are even crossed out with a sweeping red X. When did they start this? You close the book, unable to read further. They were cutting open so many parts, with no idea what they were actually looking for. A queasiness pools in your stomach.<br><br>

        “AHH!” You hear Alex scream from the other room.<br><br></p>
