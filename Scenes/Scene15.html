        <h1>Room 15</h1>
        <p>You and Alex immediately head to the door. “Hmm,” Alex tries the key, but neither of you really expected it to work. “Maybe it’s somewhere nearby.” Alex suggests. “They kept the key in the desks last time. Perhaps it’s there.”<br><br>

        That, or you could see if there’s something in the patients’ rooms. Alex doesn’t seem to fond of that idea. “I’m sure it’s in the desks, there wouldn’t be much point to putting it in a patient’s room.” But perhaps there’s something else, something other than a key. Maybe someone. It could be worth checking.<br><br></p>
