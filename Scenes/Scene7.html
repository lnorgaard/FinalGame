        <h1>Room 7</h1>
        <p>“Here, here, I can show you.” Alex runs over to the stairwell door and begins fidgeting with the lock. “Aha! See!” They call to you. “It totally works! That’s the first time I tried it actually… But it totally works!”<br><br>

        You can’t deny it. And it really seems like the only way. Unless you could somehow open that main exit by yourself. Maybe there’s a key for that lying around somewhere, too. But even then, escaping won’t cure you. Where will you go? Home? To the authorities? They’ll put you right back in here. You glance between the two doors, and at Alex’s concerned face.<br><br></p>
