        <p>The next floor is again upsettingly familiar. It detracts substantially from the feelings of progress that had just swelled within you. How many floors are there again? Will you have to go through all of them? Your worry is broken up by Alex’s voice.<br><br>

        “Let’s split up.” The words shock you. Now? “Whoa, whoa, not like, separate.” Alex assures you. “I mean like, we could snoop around different places. We’ll move faster that way.” Your heart rests a little, but you’re still not particularly fond of the idea. Alex doesn’t hear out your dissent however.<br><br>

        “Don’t act like such a baby,” Alex laughs. “I won’t be far away.” You don’t see this as a joke. You’re going to need some medicine again very soon. “Fine, take half.” Alex hands you a packet of crackers and pours some pills into your hand. “Now come on,” Alex presses impatiently. “Here, I’ll even let you can pick. Check the patients’ doors or the desks: It’s up to you.”<br><br></p>
