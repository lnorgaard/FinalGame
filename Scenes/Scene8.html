        <p>This is your best chance. You and Alex advance to the next level, but even this small interaction has taken a large toll on you. Being as weak as you are, your foot slips off the third step and you fall flat on the stairs. “Oh, shit! Are you okay?” Alex, who had only been a few steps ahead of you turns around to help you up. “When was the last time you took your medicine?” They inquire, already pulling out the crackers and water. You sit on the steps and digest a few crackers before taking two large pills. You take your time waiting for your stomach to settle as Alex rubs your back. “You didn’t get hurt anywhere? No scratches?”<br><br>


        You shake your head no. “Just tripped. I’m fine.” The time limit on your body is becoming more and more evident. You need to keep moving.<br><br></p>
