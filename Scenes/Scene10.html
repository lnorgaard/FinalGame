        <p>“Please. I can’t do this alone. Do you know how lucky it is we’re both alive? We should go on together.”<br><br>

        You stand firm. Alex doesn’t want to let you go, but decides better of arguing with you any longer. “If you change your mind, don’t waste time, and come straight to me.” <br><br>

        You nod, and Alex exits to the upper floor. You are now on your own. Your first puzzle is key code to exit the hospital.<br><br></p>
