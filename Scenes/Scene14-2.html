        <h1>Room 14-2</h1>
        <p>Alex has a small mallet in their bag resembling the ones used to get to fire extinguishers. Thank god for emergency preparedness. It’s just strong enough that with a couple swings, most of these old desk locks can be broken. “Here, I’m gonna look for any drawer that’s already open. You try busting this one open.” Alex passes you the mallet and begins searching. Your first few swings are timid, afraid of making too much noise and getting caught, but it occurs to you that no one is here to catch you. Yeah, your and Alex’s life is at stake, along with lots of others. Your swings become more confident and eventually the drawer breaks open.<br><br>

        Nothing.<br><br>

        But a few drawers later, after Alex had already returned to you fruitless, you discover a lockbox. “Perfect!” Alex pulls out the charts and points to the birthday on one of them. “Try this, 08171989.”<br><br>

        You both look at each other in amazement. Inside is another bronze key, obviously to the door. This is actually working. “Let’s go, let’s go!” you cheer, suddenly filled with hope. “Alright, alright!” Alex laughs. “Don’t get too excited, we can’t have you passing out on me.”<br><br></p>
