        <h1>Room 3</h1>
        <p>You open the door of your room cautiously, anticipating chaos. Instead, there is utter stillness. No one is here. Even some of the lights have flickered out. You knock on another patient’s door. No response, but you’re not sure if it’s because the room or the occupant is vacant. You check the exit doors. Locked, and not in the easy way. This place is fortified; that’s why they quarantined you here. Panic increasing, you run to the other side of the hall and jostle the handle to the stairwell. Also locked, but perhaps you could break through with some tools. You turn to the cluster of nurses desks running down the middle of the hall you’d previously ignored. There are a few papers that have been left behind. You approach them quickly but are stopped by a sudden BANG. <br><br>

        “Ow~” A head slowly rises from beneath the desks. “Sorry, sorry. Just hit my head, no worries.” They rub the back of their head gently and offer an apologetic smile. “I didn’t mean to scare you.” The person shuffles their way out of the desks to examine you up close. “So someone else is still kicking? I thought I was the last one.” You remain stiff, scanning the newcomer. A patient judging by the hospital gown. Shame they aren’t staff, but at least you aren’t alone.<br><br></p>
