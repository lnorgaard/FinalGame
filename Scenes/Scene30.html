        <h1>Room 30</h1>
        <p>Alex scoops you into a passionate hug. “Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I knew you’d understand.” They squeeze you tightly for a few more twists of their shoulders and then push you to arm’s length to look you dead in the eye. “I know reaching into that vat was a lot for you. You must be feeling so tired and sick.” Alex drops their bag to the floor and sets it up like a cushion against the wall. “How about you rest here while I check this next hallway, and then I’ll come back for you if I find anything important?”<br><br>

        It’s not that you aren’t suspicious of Alex anymore, but at this point, you’re beyond exhausted, emotionally and physically. Any relief from the stress of being with Alex is welcome, and you could use a few minutes to sit down. You go along with Alex’s plan and fall asleep almost instantly after you sit down.<br><br>

        When you finally wake up, not much has changed. Alex still isn’t back, and you’re not entirely sure how long you’ve been out. The nap only helped marginally to bring back your strength, so you continue to wait, but time passes and Alex still hasn’t returned. There’s a few things that could’ve happened: 1) You haven’t been out very long and Alex will return soon. 2) The hospital is much larger than anticipated and Alex has simply gone very far in. 3) Alex is hurt and cannot return, or 4) Alex ditched you. The last two linger on your mind. You aren’t in great condition, so waiting until you feel more awake might be a smart idea. But then again, you’ve never really been in a “good” condition since you arrived at this hospital. You remember being in your hospital bed and wondering what to do.<br><br></p>
