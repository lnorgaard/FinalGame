        <p>You pop your last two pills with a new found determination and ascend the final flight of stairs.At the top is less of a hallway and more of a small room with multiple doors to either side of you. Each one has a thin vertical window that appears to lead down various halls, but the most promising door lies directly opposite you. This one is metal, a lot like the main entrance door, and has swipe access installed. You walk over to examine the door more carefully when rapid footsteps come up behind you. You don’t even fully twist around when Alex’s hand snatches your wrist and drags you to the swipe reader for the door. Pressing your medical bracelet to the reader, there’s a loud BEEP, and the doors open to reveal a freezing, barren room, with only one operating table and a nursing cart featuring a single, small syringe.<br><br>

        Alex drops your wrist and runs for this object, holding it like a sacred object.<br><br>

        “This is it. The only antidote they ever managed to make.”<br><br>

        You can’t believe it. Is this for real? Alex is on the verge of tears. “You have no idea what I did for this. What I sacrificed.”<br><br>

        You approach Alex slowly. “So… we’re saved?”<br><br>

        Alex jolts back, clutching the syringe close to their chest. “It’s... one dose.”<br><br>

        You stare at one another in silence while it sinks in.<br><br>

        “We, can’t split it?”<br><br>

        What a stupid question. Of course the answer is no. Alex straightens up slightly, but keep the antidote protected. “You need to believe me. I need this more than you.”<br><br>

        Oh no. No, no.<br><br>

        “Please,” Alex takes very cautious steps, one at a time toward the door behind you. “You can wait once I get out for another to be made, but I can’t. I don’t have time left.” Alex is within reaching distance now and is about to make a break through the door.<br><br></p>
