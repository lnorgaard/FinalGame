        <h1>Room 22</h1>
        <p>You decide against pushing Alex for answers. Perhaps some things are better left secret. To help brush away the tension, Alex suggests you both finish looking through the patients’ files together. It’s quiet, but the awkwardness eventually subsides, and you run out of papers to sift through.
“I probably missed something in the desks.” You offer.
“Probably.” Alex agrees.
You head over, mallet in hand, but Alex swipes it from you. “You must be tired. Let me do it.” Again you concede to Alex’s wishes and wait patiently as they beat drawer after drawer. It’s nice to get to sit down for a moment. You haven’t stopped standing for hours. It’s so nice, you almost doze off, but just shy of sleep, Alex tugs gently on your pinky and brings you back to the present.
“I think I know where it is now.” They pass you a scrap paper with the number 336 written on it.
“A room number?” You ask. Alex nods in agreement. “We can probably bust down the door.” And so you do. Alex hammers repeatedly at the handle until it breaks off, but this time the head of the mallet goes flying off with it. You both watch it spin across the floor, stunned. “Well, I guess that’s the end of that,” Alex half jokes. But at least now you can get this door open. Alex pulls out the last bits of the knob’s interior infrastructure to clear the small hole the door where it used to sit. “No offense, but the sickness has got you a lot thinner than me,” They state. “Think you can slip your hand through there and turn the lock?”
You give it a try, and sure enough, albeit with some forceful shoving, you’re able to reach up to the lock and turn it. The door swings open from the release and you pull your hand back out with some minor scraping from the wood. Observing this, Alex picks up your hand and wipes away the remaining debris from it with the edge of their shirt.
“Be careful.” They don’t let go of your hand, but simply drop it to their side and turn to scan the opened room. A person rests in the patient’s bed, motionless. Both you and Alex have the thought to squint to check for subtle breathing, but even that is undetectable. You don’t mention aloud your shared awareness that this person is indeed freshly deceased.
More crucial to your mission is the glint of a bronze key under the bed. Alex squeezes your hand. You peer over at them out of the corner of your eye, somewhat afraid to let the body completely out of your sight. “Scared?”
“Ha, yeah, just a bit.” Alex laughs, not trying to conceal how much those words understate their true feelings. “Think you can grab this one?”
You aren’t particularly fond of approaching death either, but you muster the courage in the name of becoming a more useful partner to Alex from now on. Fortunately, no one rises from the dead, but that doesn’t stop you from moving fairly hastily through the next stairwell door. <br><br></p>
