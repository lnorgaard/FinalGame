        <p>“Alright,” Alex nods. “If you need me, just holler.” You begin to sift through the patient files and jostle doorknobs while Alex pursues the desks. So far, nothing interesting, but you’re having trouble concentrating since your headache has developed into a pounding migraine. You chew some crackers and pick out two pills from your hand to ease the pain. Wait, water. Alex must’ve forgot. You peek over your shoulder back at them, concentratedly studying some papers. Your mouth opens slightly, but somehow can’t bring yourself to call out to them, worried you might get scolded again. You decide better of it and simply swallow the pills dry.<br><br>

        A few minutes later, right as you were starting to give up, you spot the corner of a yellow note slipped between a patient’s door. You pull the paper out carefully and read the shaky words:<br><br>

        I know you’ll be back soon. If I’ve fallen asleep by the time you see this, I’m sorry, but I promise, I haven’t given up yet. I haven’t given up on you. I’m still hanging on, so don’t give up on me. Stay safe. -J<br><br>

        Was this person waiting for someone who’d promised to save them? They must have been communicating regularly, despite the strict rules on visitation. A pang of envy hits you. You had always blamed the sickness for your loneliness, but to think someone with the same disease could have a person who cared so much.<br><br>

        “Whatchu got there?” You whirl around to find Alex standing behind you.<br><br>

        “I-I found this.” You stutter. “Though, I don’t think it’ll help much.”<br><br>

        You pass the note Alex, and they read it slowly. Suddenly, their face twists up as they sharply inhale through their nose. “Why are you reading things like this?”<br><br>

        You’re taken back by the accusatory tone. “I didn’t know what it was. I thought it might be useful.”<br><br>

        “It’s a waste of time!” Alex rages. “Clearly, I can’t trust you to search on your own. Don’t you feel any pressure at all? We could die at anytime, we don’t know anything about this disease. Have you thought about that?” Of course you have. You were doing the best you can. What happened? Weren’t you two doing perfectly fine a minute ago?<br><br>

        “We need to move faster. There are other people, people in other hospitals even we might be able to save if you weren’t so slow. Hand me those pills I gave you.”<br><br>

        What?<br><br>

        “Give them to me!”<br><br>

        You hand them over hastily, hoping to calm Alex down by abiding. Alex grimaces at them for a moment, then throws them across the room. “From now on you have to ask me if you want medicine. I can’t trust you not to be wasteful.”<br><br>

        Wh- wasteful? Had they not just tossed out 6 perfectly good pills? But arguing is likely the worst idea in this situation. Instead, you merely hang your head and wait for Alex’s harsh eyes to leave you.<br><br>

        “It’s not only for your good, it’s for the good of everyone. We have a responsibility.” It’s true. Who’s to say you and Alex aren’t the only people left who can save everyone? But, isn’t that a bit ambitious?<br><br>

        You pause. This is exactly what Alex was talking about, wasn’t it? You’re so quick to give up. That’s right. This is an overwhelmingly stressful situation. Alex is just as panicked as you, they’re just handling it differently. Probably better since they’re motivated to make some change. Unlike you who’s too scared for themselves to have even considered saving others.<br><br>

        “I’m sorry.” You apologize. Alex relaxes and takes up your hands. “It’ll be okay soon. Let’s just keep going.”<br><br></p>
