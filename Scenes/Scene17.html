        <h1>Room 17</h1>
        <p>Alex turns to you before heading up the stairs this time. “Do you need help?”<br><br>

        “No, I think I’m alright. I’ll probably need some more medicine before we go up the next staircase though.” You begin to climb the stairs slowly.<br><br>

        “Alright,” Alex breezily hops up next to you and keeps a close eye in case you trip again. You pause and give Alex a glance over.<br><br>

        “Are you…” You pause, skeptical of your own thoughts, but Alex looks at you with gentle concern, so you finish anyway. “Are you really sick?”<br><br>

        Alex doesn’t change position, but their eyes widen ever so slightly. “What?” They’re clearly offended you’d dare to ask. You instantly regret asking, but it’s too late.<br><br>

        “I’m sorry, I-it’s just,”<br><br>

        “How could you say that?” Alex shouts with tense fists and a look of disbelief. “You think I’m not sick just because I’m not as weak as you?”<br><br>

        You think you catch some tears forming in the corners of their eyes before they huff and turn away. Oh crap, you didn’t mean to do this.<br><br>

        “I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have...”<br><br>

        Alex cuts you off. “I haven’t been sick that long.” They mumble, trying to hide the shakiness of their voice. “But do you know how scary it has been waiting for the symptoms to settle in? Getting the results from that blood-test, knowing what I’ll soon end up like?” Alex holds their left arm out to you. It has visible recent scars and a blue hospital bracelet. They take a deep breath, and continue, slightly more composed. “Do you remember that feeling? After finding-out you tested positive, and then being shunned by everyone you know? How alone you felt?”<br><br>

        Of course you remember. You actually were one of the few who already had symptoms by the time the blood-tests had been mandated by the government to separate all you “undesirables” out from the rest of the population. People turned on you so fast, and the few who tried to be supportive eventually started visiting less and less.<br><br>

        “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bring up bad memories.” You apologize.<br><br>

        “It’s okay,” Alex sighs, finally releasing the tension in their shoulders. “This whole thing is a bad memory that won’t end, but maybe it will now… now that I found you.”<br><br>

        Alex takes your hand again in a reassuring gesture. For the first time in a long time, you smile. For the first time in a long time, you don’t feel so alone.<br><br></p>
