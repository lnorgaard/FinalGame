        <p>You test a few knobs and find them all locked. Alex begins to rifle through the patient's files kept in plastic file organizers mounted next to each door. Is that okay? You suppose under such dire circumstances it can’t be that big of a deal. Besides, they’d wouldn’t leave the important files just out like this, would they?

        “Look at this. See how the birthdays are marked differently. It seems like this one is special.” The date you point to is marked with a star scribbled in red despite all other notes being penned in black. Alex takes the papers from you and studies them carefully. “The birthday must be the code.” After quickly memorizing the number, they hand the papers back to you and run over to the lockbox to give it a try.<br><br>

        You and Alex make eye contact upon the sound. Alex then quickly retrieves the key from inside to hold up for you to see. “I told you the code had to be around here!” They smile proudly. You pat yourself on the back for discovering the code and head over to catch up with Alex.<br><br></p>
