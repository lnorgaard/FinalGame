        <h1>Room 20</h1>
        <p>You gesture toward the desks reluctantly. The desks have always been a safe bet. Alex nods and parts way with you to examine the patients’ doors. You begin checking all the unlocked drawers, hoping to avoid having to smash anymore property. You do feel marginally safer with the mallet in your hands, but swinging it is getting more and more strenuous. It’s not that the medicine isn’t helping, but you’re definitely getting worse. Your “top condition” probably couldn’t match the average 60-year-old anymore. Finding the key isn’t quite enough motivation for you anymore, either. When is this really going to end? Will you ever find anything? The power’s still on so there must be some people here, but who’s to say they’ll help you? What if all you do is get to the roof and wonder why you ever bothered? You slow down your pace and take a glimpse at how Alex is doing.<br><br>

        Reading some papers, not surprising, but they have a strange skew to their expression. You walk over to check on how they’re doing. “Alex?”<br><br>

        Alex jumps, instinctively crumpling one of the notes in their hand to hide its contents from you. “What?” They ask stiffly.<br><br>

        “What was that?” You question in return, reaching for the yellow paper. Alex bats your hand away and turns from you defensively. “It’s nothing.” They insist, eyes avoiding yours. “Just a personal note, nothing helpful. We shouldn’t be reading that kind of thing anyway.” They shove it in their pocket and pretend to continue reading through the other documents, but it’s obvious they aren’t focused.<br><br></p>
