        <p>“Huh?” A new scene is before you. The lights flicker dimly. Rather than stairs, you and Alex are met with a long narrow corridor of cork boards full of papers leading up to yet another wooden door, barely ajar. Your first instinct is to make a break for it, but Alex lingers behind to pull down a bulletin from the wall. You tread back to read over their shoulder. It’s a newspaper article marked with a large red “redacted” stamp whose headline reads “Antidote Development Success!”<br><br>

        Adrenaline pulses through you. “Really?” Alex answers by reading the rest aloud:<br><br>

        The ---- Hospital and Research Labs, after years of work since the earliest outbreak of what is being called the Reaper’s Disease, have miraculously developed an antidote. In-depth explanations of how this cure was discovered have yet to be released to the public, but many are saying the cost of concocting even one dose is exceedingly high.<br><br>

        Alex pauses there and flips to another page: a second version of the article attached underneath marked “approved”:<br><br>

        Testing continues at ---- Hospital and Research Labs. Teams work tirelessly to find a cure, and promise hope to the public. The CEO commented, “While we have yet to discover a cure, our relief medicine continues to be effective in slowing the disease’s progression. As long as we continue to mandate testing on all citizens, we can effectively quarantine carriers and protect the public until a cure is found.<br><br>

        Alex scoffs. “Protect the public. Who do they think we are?” You don’t take much offense since the prospect of a cure is far more provoking.<br><br>

        “Do you think it’s true? That they found a cure?”<br><br>

        Alex tacks the articles back to the wall. “I know it’s true,” They hiss. “Those bastards just chickened out when they realized they couldn’t release the cure without being questioned on why they proceeded when the government mandated them to stop.”<br><br>

        A heat surges to the surface of your skin. “We have to find it.” You book it to the end of the hall and shove your way through the door, Alex tailing behind.<br><br>

        The view is yet again new. The walls are crusted, and there’s a distinctly fowl chemical smell in the air. Many of the doors have been left open, aside from one at the very end of the hall much like all the previous staircase doors. You run to check that this one was not also left unlocked, but when you go to twist the handle, it sticks. Let down, the rush of hope abates and a dizziness begins to take it’s place. When was the last time you took meds? Even though you took more, is the effect wearing off faster? Before you can ask, Alex calls to you from the other end of the hall.<br><br>

        “I want to check this room! Do you think you can explore on your own this time, or should I go with you?”<br><br></p>
