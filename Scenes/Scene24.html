        <p>Go to the door. Secret stuff. Instead of stairs, you find a hallway inside the room. There is a separate wing in the hospital that you get to. More of a research facility. You feel the symptoms and have to take your medicine. The antagonist doesn’t take the medicine, and you question them about the disease. The antagonist doesn’t explain.</p>
