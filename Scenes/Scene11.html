        <p>You proceed to examine the main door. This was the right choice, you assure yourself. Something felt off, you know it. Besides, if worst comes to worst you can just find Alex now that the door to the stairs is unlocked. Probably. If you don’t get lost. Or Alex hasn’t locked the doors. A rush of panic rises in your chest. They wouldn’t… unless you really offended them with that constant doubt. You may have just alienate the only person who can help you.<br><br>

        No, no, it’s fine to go it alone. You have before and you can again. You can tell this door uses some automated locking feature, so there must be a button or some wires you can finagle to trick it open. But you didn’t see any fuse boxes on this floor, and it’s not like the power isn’t on. Plus, what do you know about engineering?<br><br>

        No, focus! Check the desks for those alarm buttons they have in banks. Maybe there’s a key to like… a secret door?<br><br>

        This won’t do. You’ve been checking around for at least an hour. You’re starting to feel really unwell again, and this door isn’t going to start cooperating anytime soon. You need to try something else, and maybe find some supplies while you’re at it.<br><br></p>
