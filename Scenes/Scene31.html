        <p>In a sudden act of rebellion, you rip your hand from Alex’s and scramble to get through the next door and slam it shut behind you. You lock it right as Alex’s body slams against the wood with a howl of anguish. “NO! PLEASE!” They beg, banging on the door. “DON’T LEAVE ME, PLEASE! I’M SORRY! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!” They wail. “NOT HERE! PLEASE!”<br><br></p>
