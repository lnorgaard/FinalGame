        <p>Clearly, there was something that really affected Alex on that slip of paper. “I don’t understand, can’t you just let me see it?”<br><br>

        “NO.” Alex throws the papers down, hands clenched in fists. Their glare is harsh, but their eyes appear to be holding back tears. You can’t think of anything that could’ve made them this upset. All you can do is raise your hands slowly in concession. “I’m sorry.”<br><br>

        Alex’s body softens at the apology. They take a deep breath, eyes closing momentarily before eyeing you seriously. “Why are you so unwilling to trust me?” Their tone is flat but unmistakably hurt. “Don’t you understand how dire things are? I’m just trying to help you, but I can’t if you keep questioning everything I do.”<br><br>

        Regret washes over you. So it wasn’t even the note, it was you. Despite knowing how much stress you both are under, you’re the one that pushed Alex to this point. “I’m sorry,” you say again.<br><br>

        “Don’t apologize, just… stop wasting the time you could be searching the desks on doubting me.”<br><br>

        You nod, unsure of what else to say. Alex tries to diffuse the tension with a brief brush of their hand on your shoulder, but it only feels like pity.<br><br>

        “Stay close to me from now on?” Alex softly requests. There’s no choice to say no.<br><br></p>
