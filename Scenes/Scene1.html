        <h1>Room 1</h1>
        <p>It’s been about a month since you were committed to this hospital. Frankly, it feels longer. The medicine is helping less and less, not to mention the hospital staff– When was the last time someone came to check on you?<br><br>

        You shake your pill bottle: running low. You can’t sit idly anymore. Tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of people have been checked into hospitals like this with the same affliction. It arose seemingly out of nowhere. Medical professionals have been scrambling to find a cure.<br><br>

        But that doesn’t excuse this neglect.<br><br>

        You check the chart by your bed. The last signature of visitation was three days ago. Maybe four? They confiscated your phone and personal belongings at check in, so time’s grown elusive.<br><br>

        There’s not much else you can do. Wait it out until someone comes or get up and take matters into your own hands.<br><br></p>
