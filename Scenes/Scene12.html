        <p>You search the desks for hours, but to no avail. There isn’t much left, and the few documents you have found are primarily illegible chicken scratch. Alex probably already collected all the important things. It would be nice if you could at least find some more meds though. You’ve become extremely faint, even keeping your eyes open is a challenge. You didn’t expect to hurt this much this fast. At the rate you’ll never catch up with Alex. Your only hope is if they come back for you. But why would they when you rejected them so decidedly?<br><br>

        You slip slowly to the ground, feeling sleep attempt to embrace you. Maybe you never should’ve stopped waiting in that bed to begin with. It’s okay, you tell yourself. Alex can do it, right? Find a way out or some cure. If they do, they’ll come back for you and everything will be okay, for sure. You repeat this consolation in your mind until you can no longer concentrate on your own thoughts, and your consciousness slips away.<br><br></p>
