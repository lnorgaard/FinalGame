        <p>“You go on ahead. I want to explore down here some more.” Alex breaks into a frown.<br><br>

        “I’ve already searched this floor, trust me, the most important thing was this key. We have to move on.”<br><br>

        “I can catch up later.”<br><br>

        “What if it’s too late by then?” The words come out harshly. “Sorry, I’m.., I’m just worried about you. Who knows how soon you’ll be too weak to walk.” The thought makes you a bit cautious of your own decision. “There’s nothing to get out of staying alone.” Alex insists. “I have the medicine, just come with me. Trust me.”<br><br></p>
