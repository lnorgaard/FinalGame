        <p>“You go on ahead. I want to explore down here some more.” Alex breaks into a frown.<br><br>

        “I’ve already searched this floor, trust me, the most important thing was this key. We have to move on.”<br><br>

        “I can catch up later”<br><br>

        “What if it’s too late by then? Who knows how soon you’ll be too weak to walk. I have the medicine, but I can’t leave these supplies with you, so just come with me. There’s nothing to get out of staying alone. Trust me.”<br><br></p>
