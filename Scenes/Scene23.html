        <h1>Room 23</h1>
        <p>You finish up combing through the last of the patients’ files together in silence. Unless the staff suddenly got very creative with their codes, you don’t think you’ve found anything useful. Most of the documents haven’t been updated for weeks. They hadn’t even bothered to mark patients as deceased, likely because when they abandoned them, they were still alive, like you. A shiver runs down your spine, but Alex is already heading toward the desks to inspect them more carefully, so you don’t allow the perturbance to settle in.<br><br>

        Once you catch up, Alex raps on a desk drawer with their knuckle to indicate you should open it. You lift the mallet from your pocket and prep to swing, but Alex stops you. “Let me do it.” A panic strikes you abruptly. Should you really be handing them your only weapon right now? Before your mind can answer, Alex has slipped it from your hands. Even though you see it coming, the bang against the drawer startles you. You realize you can’t pacify your nerves anymore. Is it the sickness? Between drawers you ask Alex for some more medicine to try a calm down. They comply kindly, but you can sense their watchful gaze as you take four pills instead of two.<br><br>

        It’s Alex. It clicks now. You can’t handle feeling so surveyed, like at any moment you’ll slip up and that mallet will be making contact with you.<br><br>

        Alex apologizes “I care about you, I want us both to survive, but it’s hard when you’re constantly treating me like I’m so suspicious.”<br><br>

        No no no. You’re worrying way too much. Even if Alex has gotten mad before, they’ve never hit you. And if they hated you so much, couldn’t they have left you behind long ago? They want to help you. You can’t have the only person here to help you turning on you. How can you make them trust you again?<br><br></p>
