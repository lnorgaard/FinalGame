        <h1>Room 23</h1>
        <p>You finish up combing through the last of the patients’ files together in silence. Unless the staff suddenly got very creative with their codes, you don’t think you’ve found anything useful. Most of the documents haven’t been updated for weeks. They hadn’t even bothered to mark patients as deceased, likely because when they abandoned them, they were still alive, like you. A shiver runs down your spine, but Alex is already heading toward the desks to inspect them more carefully, so you don’t allow the perturbance to settle in.<br><br>

        Once you catch up, Alex raps on a desk drawer with their knuckle to indicate you should open it. You lift the mallet from your pocket and prep to swing, but Alex stops you. “Let me do it.” A panic strikes you abruptly. Should you really be handing them your only weapon right now? Before your mind can answer, Alex has slipped it from your hands. Even though you see it coming, the bang against the drawer startles you. You realize you can’t pacify your nerves anymore. Is it the sickness? Between drawers you ask Alex for some more medicine to try a calm down. They comply kindly, but you can sense their watchful gaze as you take four pills instead of two. Only four left.<br><br>

        Then it hits you. It’s Alex. You can’t handle feeling so surveyed... like at any moment you’ll slip up and that mallet will be making contact with you.<br><br>

        No, no, no, no, no! You’re over exaggerating way too much. Even if Alex has gotten mad before, they’ve never hit you. And if they hated you so much, couldn’t they have left you behind long ago? Alex has said repeatedly that they care about you. Of course they’re upset when you doubt them. They’ve done nothing but invest in your health and safety. Have you expressed any real gratitude this entire time? All Alex wants is your trust, you tell yourself. You have the power to make them happy, and they have the power to get you both out of here.<br><br>

        Right as you’ve come to this resolution, Alex tugs gently on your pinky and brings you back to the present. “I think I know where it is now.” They pass you a scrap paper with the number 336 written on it.<br><br>

        “A room number?” You ask. Alex nods in agreement. “We can probably bust down the door.” And so you do. Alex hammers repeatedly at the handle until it breaks off, but this time the head of the mallet goes flying off with it. You both watch it spin across the floor, stunned. “Well, I guess that’s the end of that,” Alex half jokes. But at least now you can get this door open. Alex pulls out the last bits of the knob’s interior infrastructure to clear the small hole the door where it used to sit. “No offense, but the sickness has got you a lot thinner than me,” They state. “Think you can slip your hand through there and turn the lock?”<br><br>

        You give it a try, and sure enough, albeit with some forceful shoving, you’re able to reach up to the lock and turn it. The door swings open from the release and you pull your hand back out with some minor scraping from the wood. Observing this, Alex picks up your hand and wipes away the remaining debris from it with the edge of their shirt.<br><br>

        “Be careful.” They don’t let go of your hand, but simply drop it to their side and turn to scan the opened room. A person rests in the patient’s bed, motionless. Both you and Alex have the thought to squint to check for subtle breathing, but even that is undetectable. You don’t mention aloud your shared awareness that this person is indeed freshly deceased.<br><br>

        More crucial to your mission is the glint of a bronze key under the bed. Alex squeezes your hand. You peer over at them out of the corner of your eye, somewhat afraid to let the body completely out of your sight. “Scared?”<br><br>

        “Ha, yeah, just a bit.” Alex laughs, not trying to conceal how much those words understate their true feelings. “Think you can grab this one?”<br><br>

        You aren’t particularly fond of approaching death either, but you muster the courage in the name of becoming a more useful partner to Alex from now on. Fortunately, no one rises from the dead, but that doesn’t stop you from moving fairly hastily through the next stairwell door.<br><br></p>
